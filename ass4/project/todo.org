* high-idf terms only search

* authority signals (citations?)
  - Enhancing Patent Retrieval by Citation Analysis (Atsushi
    Fujii 2007)
  - topic-sensitive citation-based method + text-based retrieval

* query term proximity!

** query expansion
** add in query term proximity?

* submissions stuff
** modify printing to print to a single line instead of 1 patent per line

* sequence:
  - implement indexing
    + +universal first+
    + then the index_file targets
  - implement search
  - consider skiplists
  - perf testing


* defensive stuff-
  - ensure that dirs have trailing slash etc.
  - ensure that names are properly escaped?
