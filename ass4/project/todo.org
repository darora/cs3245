* high-idf terms only search

* authority signals (citations?)
  - Enhancing Patent Retrieval by Citation Analysis (Atsushi
    Fujii 2007)
  - topic-sensitive citation-based method + text-based retrieval

* query term proximity!

* order of things
** time blist vs list

** query expansion
** add in query term proximity?

** make input defensive! <-- mentioned in pdf

* submissions stuff
** modify printing to print to a single line instead of 1 patent per line

* sequence:
  - implement indexing
    + +universal first+
    + then the index_file targets
  - implement search
  - make the first step of the indexing script a call to the makefile
    to install the libraries
  - consider skiplists
  - perf testing
