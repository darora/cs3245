########## Q1

Handling phrasal queries in a VSM.

Instead of storing just a term frequency number for each document in a
postings list, we should store positional indices as well.

Later, when we calculate the cosine similarity of the query to the
documents, we introduce an additional logarithmic parameter as a
weight. This is proportional to the size of the ordered contiguity of
the results (i.e. grows as the number of instances of the
phrase goes up), and works off of a baseline of 1. As we would need
the positional indices in order to calculate this, the entire
calculation becomes an inefficient, two-pass affair at the very least.

However, this allows us to give priority to phrasal matches, but also
return results that match the individual terms but not the phrase
itself (the next best thing).

########## Q2

My search engine normalizes the weights among the queries. However,
since we are instructed not to normalize the documents, longer
documents would get greater priority than shorter one in the results
sorting.

lnc.ltc on the other hand would normalize the documents as well. This
would reduce the impact the sheer length of a document has on its
priority in the results list.

I verified this over a small sample set of queries from the IVLE forum
(included as "queries"). I tested my engine using lnn.ltc, against
lnc.ltc, and the results were (calculated using the included
"compare_outputs.py" script)--

,----
| Average length of document for lnn.ltc: 45 lines
| Average length of document for lnc.ltc: 36 lines
`----

Although this isn't in and of itself a mark of an improvement in
quality, but if we were to assume that at least some of the shorter
documents were important to the user's searches, this would indicate
that lnc.ltc is better at normalizing document lengths as a signal of
their importance.

(i.e., lnn.ltc doesn't seem to be sufficient to handle the problem.)

########## Q3

Yes. Even if only some of the documents contain the fields, we can
consider it to be a weak signal of relevance, thereby not penalizing
other documents _too_ much whilst also making use of the information
that is available to us.

For instance, one zone that we should make definite use of is the
title, which pretty much *all* the docs contain as an all-uppercase
line at the beginning of the doc. Moreover, the title ought to serve
as a pretty strong signal for relevance as well.
